EACH CELL MUST "KNOW" THE FOLLOWING:
What the current "time" is
- could be an actual time-keeping device
- could be based on how much time it takes to build up a chemical
- could be based on how much compression is in existence because of too many cells
- could be based on size of the cell because each split makes them smaller (before gastrulation)
What they currently are
- could be stored in any number of ways. They are what they are.
