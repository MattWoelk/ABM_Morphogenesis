EACH CELL MUST "KNOW" THE FOLLOWING:

What the current "time" is:
- could be an actual time-keeping device
- could be based on how much time it takes to build up a chemical
- could be based on how much compression is in existence because of too many cells
- could be based on size of the cell because each split makes them smaller (before gastrulation)

What they currently are:
- could be stored in any number of ways. They are what they are.

Who are beside them:
- could be cell-to-cell communication

How many of their kind there are:
- could be morphogens

A way to pass information:
- could be waves of information
- could be push and pull forces
- could be gradients
- could be morphogens
- could be electrostatic

What to turn into:
- could be based on concentrations of chemicals
- could be based on being squished or stretched

1. What they know (I'm a thing! I'm beside a thang!)
2. What they communicate (I'm this, you're that, ???)
3. What that communication looks like overall (waves, gradients, etc.)

One cell could be the "start everything that happens" cell by keeping one with a special state whenever they split.
- That way we could have a master cell which would start waves and gradients and things.
